From our investigation we found that the current behavior is:

a.For App Engine Standard apps:
Task Queues, Cron, Cloud Tasks & Cloud Scheduler traffic will be allowed by the default rule even when it is set to deny.

b.For App Engine Flex apps:
Task Queues, Cron, Cloud Tasks & Cloud Scheduler traffic will be denied by the default rule if it is set to deny. In order to allow this traffic while the default rule is set to deny, users must create allow rules to whitelist two IPs (0.1.0.2 and 10.0.0.1)
