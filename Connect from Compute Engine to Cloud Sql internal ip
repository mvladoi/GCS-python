#How to connect from Compute Engine to Cloud SQL internal ip address (PHP)

> Your Compute Engine instance must be in the same region as your Cloud
> SQL instance, and on the network configured for a private connection

1.[Create the Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance) instance with internal ip address . Create a user, password and database.

2.[Getting started with PHP on Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/php/tutorials/getting-started-on-compute-engine)

After you copied the `startup-script.sh` runt this command to create the instance:
 
 
     gcloud compute instances create $MY_INSTANCE_NAME \
    --image-family=ubuntu-1804-lts \
    --image-project=ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type=g1-small \
    --scopes userinfo-email,cloud-platform,sql-admin  \
    --metadata-from-file startup-script=scripts/startup-script.sh \
    --zone $ZONE \
    --tags http-server

On the scopes we added `sql-admin`, then create the firewall rule.

3.SSH to the instance you just created.

4.Install `mysql`. You could add this part to the startup script.

     sudo apt install mysql-client-core-5.7
   
5.Test if you can connect to SQL instance using internal ip address.

    mysql --host=internall-ip-sql  --user=test --password

6.If you are able to connect then :

    cd /opt/app/routes
    sudo nano web.php

7.Add your code to `router->get('/', function (Request $request)`

8.In the browser go to http://compute-engine-instance-externall-ip

Success!
